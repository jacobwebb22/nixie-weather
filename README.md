# nixie-weather
This project seeks to upgrade my original internet enabled nixie weather clock with a raspberry Pi. I already have the internet, nixies, and time code working. I need to interface with the lcd screen via serial commands and read analog data from potentiometer knobs transfered over the i2c interface via an adafruit trinket.
